## Elastic Container Service (ECS)

This section explains the automation-related constructs for ECS.

### ContainerImagePipeline

We created a `ContainerImagePipeline` construct to bridge the gap between Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Elastic Container Service (ECS).

This construct produces an AWS CodePipeline pipeline that triggers when a Docker container image with a specific tag is pushed to an ECR repository. The pipeline then deploys the new container image version to a service running on ECS.

CodePipeline already has two useful actions that we leveraged: [ECR Source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/action-reference-ECR.html) and [ECS Deploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/action-reference-ECS.html).

The ECR Source action produces a file called `imageDetail.json` that contains details about the incoming Docker container image.

```json
{
  "ImageSizeInBytes": "<number>",
  "ImageDigest": "sha256:<64-digit hexidecimal hash>",
  "Version": "1.0",
  "ImagePushedAt": "Wed Dec 07 17:05:06 UTC 2022",
  "RegistryId": "<AWS account number>",
  "RepositoryName": "<repository name>",
  "ImageURI": "<AWS account number>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository name>@sha256:<64-digit hexidecimal hash>",
  "ImageTags": ["598", "latest"]
}
```

However, the ECS Deploy action expects a JSON file called `imagedefinitions.json` structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "<name of container in the task definition>",
    "imageUri": "<AWS account number>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository name>@sha256:<64-digit hexidecimal hash>"
  }
]
```

Luckily, CodePipeline allows arbitrary Lambda functions that can accept artifacts from previous steps and produce artifacts for subsequent steps. The `ContainerImagePipeline` construct produces a singleton Lambda function (i.e. only one per stack, regardless of the number of instances of the construct) that:

1. Downloads the input artifact (produced by ECR Source) from S3
1. Extracts the `.zip`
1. Retrieves the `imageDetail.json` from within
1. Uses it to create the `imagedefinitions.json` file
1. Creates a new `.zip` for the output artifact (sent to ECS Deploy)
1. Uploads the output artifact to S3

At that point, the ECS Deploy action:

1. Creates a new ECS Task Definition based on the one assigned to the ECS Service, replacing the container image with the value of `imageUri`
1. Updates the ECS Service to use the new ECS Task Definition
1. Forces the tasks in the ECS Service to drain and launch anew

In this way, a CI/CD pipeline can be configured to push a new Docker (or OCI) container image tag to the ECR repository, then add the `latest` tag to the new image and push it as well. As soon as the `latest` tag changes, the pipeline will trigger.

If the CDK application that defines the ECS Service and Task Definition uses the `latest` tag (e.g. instead of trying to supply a fixed image tag, like `598` above), then this setup also prevents any deployments from reverting the ECS Service to an earlier image tag.

```typescript
import { Repository } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecr";
import { FargateService } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-ecs";
import { ContainerImagePipeline } from "shady-island/lib/automation";

declare const repository: Repository;
declare const service: FargateService;

new ContainerImagePipeline(stack, "Deploy", {
  repository,
  service,
  container: "Express",
  tag: "latest",
});
```
